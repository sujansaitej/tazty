We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described, and as required by applicable law, after which we anonymise or delete it.

Reality check: While we take security seriously, no system is perfectly secure. We follow industry-standard practices to reduce risk.

We do not sell or rent personal data for marketing without your explicit consent. In the event of a merger or acquisition, personal data may be transferred to the new owner subject to this Policy.

6. Your Rights
Depending on the applicable law, you may have the right to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal data, and to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. To exercise rights, contact us at support@tazty.in. We will respond as required by law.

7. Account Deletion & Data Erasure Procedure
Important: Account deletion is not instantaneous. To delete your account you must submit a deletion request via our website or by emailing support@tazty.in. The deletion process works as follows:

User submits a deletion request via the external link: User Deletion Request.
Tazty team reviews the request to confirm identity and to check for outstanding orders, disputes, fraud investigations or legal obligations.
If eligible, Tazty will delete or anonymise personal data, except for records that must be retained by law (e.g., tax/audit records).
Tazty reserves the right to accept, delay or deny deletion requests where necessary to comply with legal or business obligations.
