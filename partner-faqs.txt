Availability and Operating Hours: Restaurants that are currently open and accepting orders may appear higher than closed restaurants;
Promotional Activity: Restaurants participating in active promotional campaigns may receive enhanced visibility during the promotional period;
Relevance and Search Terms: For search queries, restaurants matching search terms, cuisine types, or menu items may be prioritized;
Platform Policies and Quality Standards: Compliance with Platform policies, quality standards, and operational requirements may influence visibility.
