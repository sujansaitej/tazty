Consent: (e.g., marketing communications, optional device permissions).
Legitimate use/necessary for the provision of our services: (e.g., order processing, settlements, fraud/security).
Compliance with law: (e.g., tax, KYC/AML, lawful requests).
6. Data Sharing & Recipients
We share information only with parties who need it to provide services or where required by law. Examples include:

Payment & Payout Partners: (e.g., aggregators, banks) — to collect buyer payments and settle merchant payouts.
Logistics Partners: — to pick up/fulfill orders, including addresses and contact details needed for fulfillment.
ONDC Participants: — to complete network transactions and dispute/issue workflows (where applicable).

7. ONDC-Specific Disclosures
For merchants operating via ONDC: certain order and catalog metadata flows to other network participants (Buyer Apps/NPs, Seller NPs, Logistics NPs, Gateways, and Registries) as required by the Beckn protocol and associated ONDC specifications. These include order/cart items, pricing/taxes, fulfillment details, locations/pincodes, and issue/returns data where applicable.

We share only what is reasonably necessary to complete network transactions and comply with settlement/reconciliation norms.

8. Data Storage, Security & Retention
We may store/process data on servers located inside India. When data is transferred, we use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards and require vendors to protect data appropriately.

We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures such as encryption in transit (HTTPS), access controls, logging, segmentation, and role-based permissions. No system is 100% secure; we monitor for incidents and respond per internal procedures and legal obligations.

Retention Periods: We retain personal data for as long as needed for the purposes above, and as required by law. Illustrative timelines:

KYC/Onboarding records: 8 years from last business activity or as mandated by law
Order & Settlement data: 8 years from transaction date (or longer if required by tax/finance laws)
Support/Issue/Dispute records: 5 years after closure
Device logs/diagnostics: 3–6 months
Marketing preferences: Until you withdraw consent or delete the account
When retention is no longer required we will delete or anonymise data.

Reality check: while we follow industry standards for security, no system is 100% secure. You acknowledge this residual risk.

Access and receive a copy of your personal data.
Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
Request deletion or anonymisation where legally permitted.

We verify identity and check for outstanding orders, disputes, or legal obligations.
If eligible, we delete or anonymise personal data except records required for legal/tax retention.
We may retain limited data for fraud prevention, dispute resolution or as required by law.
Tazty reserves the right to accept, delay or decline deletion requests where necessary to comply with legal or business obligations.

We and our service providers use cookies, device identifiers and similar technologies for authentication, analytics, security and performance. You may control some tracking via device settings; disabling identifiers may reduce functionality.

13. Cross-Border Storage & Transfers
Your data may be transferred to affiliates or service providers located outside India where necessary. We will implement appropriate safeguards such as contractual protections or other legal mechanisms required by applicable law.

14. Legal Requests & Compliance
We may disclose personal data in response to lawful requests from public authorities, law enforcement, courts or regulatory agencies, or to prevent imminent harm or fraud. We will comply with applicable legal process and where permitted will notify affected parties unless prohibited by law.

15. Third-Party Links & SDKs
Our apps may include third-party SDKs or link to external websites not controlled by us. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies. Please review those policies before use.
