Buyer Terms & Conditions
Last updated: November 5, 2025

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") form a legally binding agreement between you ("User" or "Buyer") and Valar Digital Commerce Pvt. Ltd. operating as Tazty ("Tazty", "we", "us", "our") governing your access to and use of the Tazty mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the "Platform") as a buyer of food and related services. By accessing or using the Platform you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

1. Regulatory Status
Tazty operates as a technology platform and marketplace intermediary. We are an intermediary under the Information Technology Act, 2000 and act in accordance with the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020. We do not manufacture, prepare, pack or sell goods directly; Sellers and Delivery Partners operate independently.

2. Definitions
User — any individual accessing or using the Platform.
Seller — restaurant, merchant, retailer, or other third party offering products or services on the Platform.
Delivery Partner — independent third party contracted to pick up and deliver orders.
Order — a confirmed request for goods or services placed via the Platform.
3. Eligibility
To use the Platform you must be at least 18 years old and legally competent to enter into contracts under applicable law. You must register with accurate information and are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.

4. Account Registration and Authentication
Authentication is performed via mobile number and One-Time Password (OTP). You are responsible for all activity associated with your account. Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access. Tazty may require additional verification where necessary for fraud prevention or regulatory compliance.

5. Services Provided by the Platform
The Platform lists product and service offerings provided by independent Sellers, transmits Orders to Sellers, facilitates assignment of Delivery Partners and enables payment processing. Tazty is a facilitator and does not assume title to goods or operate as a Seller or Delivery Partner.

6. Product Listings and Seller Responsibilities
Sellers are solely responsible for the accuracy of product descriptions, pricing, nutritional and allergen information, packaging, and compliance with applicable laws including FSSAI and GST. Tazty does not endorse or warrant Seller representations. If you have allergies, dietary restrictions or medical conditions, verify with the Seller prior to ordering.

7. Order Placement, Acceptance and Cancellation
An Order is deemed confirmed only when payment (except COD) is authorized and the Seller accepts the Order. Sellers may cancel Orders for legitimate reasons including item unavailability or operational constraints. Cancellation by Seller prior to preparation will result in a full refund where payment was collected.

If you cancel an Order, refunds are at the Seller's and Tazty's discretion depending on the stage of preparation; if preparation has commenced, refunds may be refused.

8. Delivery Terms
Delivery timelines provided on the Platform are estimates only. After pickup, the Delivery Partner is responsible for transit condition and delivery execution. Failed deliveries caused by incorrect address, inability to contact the recipient, refusal to accept delivery or refusal to provide access will be treated as delivered for the purposes of refunds and may not be refunded.

9. Pricing, Taxes and Fees
Prices, taxes and fees displayed on the Platform are provided by Sellers and are subject to change. Additional charges may apply including delivery fees, packaging charges, surge pricing and platform service fees. All applicable taxes are displayed during checkout.

10. Payments and Refunds
Payments are processed via third-party payment processors. Tazty does not store full payment instrument details. Refunds are processed in accordance with the Cancellation & Refund Policy and applicable law. Refund eligibility includes: (i) Seller cancellation before preparation, (ii) payment captured but Order not confirmed, and (iii) valid claims for wrong/damaged/expired items with supporting evidence.

Evidence requirement: To support a refund claim for damaged, wrong or expired goods you must provide clear photos or videos and lodge the complaint within two (2) hours of delivery. Tazty will investigate and its decision shall be final subject to applicable law.
11. Ratings, Reviews and User Content
By posting reviews, photos or other content you grant Tazty a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, publish and display such content on the Platform and for promotional purposes. You represent that you own or have rights to the content you post and that it does not infringe third-party rights.

16. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Tazty's liability for any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Platform shall be limited to the amount equal to the value of the Order giving rise to the claim. Under no circumstances shall Tazty be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data or business interruption.

17. Force Majeure
Tazty will not be liable for any failure or delay resulting from events outside its reasonable control, including natural disasters, epidemics, war, civil disturbance, government actions, internet or telecom failures, strikes, or extreme weather.

18. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of India. Parties will attempt to resolve disputes amicably via support channels.
